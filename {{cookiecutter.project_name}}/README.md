> More details about version control with [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext).

```sh
# 1 - Generate and link all jupyter notebooks to a markdown equivalent
$ jupytext --set-formats ipynb,md *.ipynb

# 2 - Make changes to notebooks and just git push as usual
#     file .gitignore won't upload .ipynb only their .md equivalent
```
